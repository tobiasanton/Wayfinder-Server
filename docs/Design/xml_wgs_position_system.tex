The supported coordinate systems and formats.

The WGS84 format is: (N|S|E|W) D(D*)$^{\circ}$ MM' SS[.dddd]'', as used in the coordinate ``\emph{N 69$^{\circ}$ 03' 35.7840'', E 24$^{\circ}$ 09' 58.8238''}''.
That is, first one letter for point of compass, from (N|S|E|W).
\emph{N} and \emph{S} are used for latitudes. \emph{E} and \emph{W} are used for longitudes.
Then D(D*) is the number of degrees, with one or more digits.
\emph{D} represents a digit in degrees.
Then MM, the number of minutes, with exactly two digits. Pad with leading zeroes to make this two digits.
\emph{M} represents a digit in minutes.
Then SS, the number of seconds, with exactly two digits. Pad with leading zeroes to make this two digits.
\emph{S} represents a digit in seconds.
Then an optional 4 digit decimal number [.dddd], the number of milliseconds.
\emph{d} represents a digit in milliseconds.
