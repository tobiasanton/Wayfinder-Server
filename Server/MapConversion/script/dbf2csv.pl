######## HISTORY ########
#
# Dbf2csv v1, 12/22/2000 - Convert .DBF files to .CSV format.
# The "-p" option selects interactive mode, for use with Perl4w.exe,
# to make a Windows program.
#
# Dbf2csv v2, 4/14/2003 - handles some ideosyncratic .dbf files with
# non-standard headers, which confused v1.
#
# Dbf2csv v3 (unreleased) - added support for fields > 255 characters
# thanks to Jeff Price, and for big-endian machines (for John McVeagh).
#
# v1 was modified (commented, corrected & enhanced to handle accented
# characters) by Jacky Bruno <jacky.bruno[at]free.fr> collËge de Villeneuve
# sur Yonne 89500, in april 2003.  His version was included in some of
# the dbf2csv.zip distributions as dbf2csv_accentued_characters.pl.
#
# Dbf2csv v4, 6/27/2003 - the result of merging most of Jacky's changes
# into the standard version of DBF2CSV.PL, plus a few more improvements.
# Also, changes '~' characters to blanks.
# [Shameless advertisement: of course I used the TLIB Version Control
# "migrate" command to do the merge and create v4.  See our web site,
# http://www.burtonsys.com/   -DAB]
#
# Dbf2csv v5, 1/24/2004 - adds the ability to properly handle FoxPro's
# 'I' fields, which are 4-byte little-endian binary integers (signed,
# I hope!).  Also, tries to tell you what program created the database,
# based on the version number.  Also, no longer changes '~'s to blanks.
#
# Dbf2csv v6, 5/7/2004 - by David MarÌn <dmarin-NO-SPAM@dyr.es>
# Handle almost all PC850 accented characters, not just French ones
#
# Dbf2csv v7, 7/19/2005 - 'F' fields now fully supported, and '+'
# fields now might work (untested, supported with a warning).  -DAB

#   - reads the first file name given and give it to the do_a_file function
#   - do the same with other command line given files
# lines 1021 to 1049 : do_a_file function (the name is clear) :
#   - verify the validity of the file (ending with .dbf)
#   - buids the .csv file name from the .dbf file name given
#   - calls the cvt1file function by giving her the 2 file names

#      input file   output file		treated records number
# lines 473 to 1016 : cvt1file function :
#   - as his name tells, do the conversion job of input file
