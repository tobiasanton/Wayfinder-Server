# When finding client setting first all rows with same Client-Type are
# searched for one with the same Client-Type-Options. If no row
# with same Client-Type-Options the row with empty Client-Type-Options
# is selected. If no empty Client-Type-Options then first best row is 
# used.
# If no rows with same Client-Type exists a default setting is used:
